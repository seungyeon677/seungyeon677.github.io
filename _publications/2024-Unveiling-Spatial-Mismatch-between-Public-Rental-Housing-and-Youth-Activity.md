<b>Abstract</b>: The continuous inflow of young people into the metropolitan area has worsen the youth’s housing instability. To solve this problem, the government provides youth and happy house to young people, aiming to live closer to their workplace, This study substantiated the regional disproportions in supply through quantitative indices within the metropolitan area. Furthermore, an examination was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the supply in relation to the daily activity patterns of the youth. This study investigates the nexus between housing supply and the daily activity patterns of youth in metropolitan areas. Results indicate that Seoul exhibits the highest daily activity levels, yet faces challenges of undersupply in numerous regions. In contrast, Incheon demonstrates lower daily activities coupled with an abundance of oversupplied regions. Gyeonggi, aligning closely with Seoul in terms of activity levels, experiences divergent supply equity between its northern and southern regions. In conclusion, this research quantitatively validation of housing supply dynamics relative to dynamic daily activity patterns, highlighting the imperative for tailored public rental housing policies at the regional level.
