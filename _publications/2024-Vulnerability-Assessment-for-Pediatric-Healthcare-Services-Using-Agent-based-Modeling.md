<b> Abstract </b>:  In South Korea we are currently facing with a decline in fertility rates and a significant reduction in pediatric healthcare resources. As a result, there is a shortage of pediatric care, which may be responsible for accelerating the collapse of the healthcare system for pediatric patients. This crisis may undermines an access to healthcare and spatial disparities in the access. Previous studies on healthcare accessibility have not adequately considered spatial accessibility, which is associated with the individual behaviors of patients and their arrival, movements, waiting, and treatment processes. To address this issue, in this study, we used an agent-based modeling to explore vulnerable areas for pediatric healthcare services while incorporating the entire processes of movements and treatment for individual patients in a dynamic environment. We take four districts in Southwest Seoul as a study area. A hot and cold spot analysis was conducted to identify actual vulnerabilities of pediatric healthcare services. The results help to assess the spatial inequalities in medical infrastructure, which in turn, supports decision making processes for stakeholders to newly install additional pediatric healthcare services.
