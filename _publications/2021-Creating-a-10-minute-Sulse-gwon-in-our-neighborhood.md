<b>Abstract</b>: In the past, South Korea focused its efforts on constructing large-scale infrastructure, such as roads and railways, through massive capital investments. While this contributed significantly to national economic growth and rising income levels, it also led to several issues, including a low perceived quality of life and widening regional disparities. To address these challenges, the government introduced the "Living SOC" (Social Overhead Capital) initiative in 2018, aiming to improve public welfare and safety through facilities such as childcare centers, senior welfare centers, emergency medical services, public libraries, and parks.
As part of the Urban Regeneration New Deal projects in Seoul, the "10-Minute Neighborhood Project" was launched. This project incorporates Living SOC to establish essential service facilities and community hubs designed to enhance the quality of life at a micro-residential level and restore local communities. This approach is particularly relevant in the post-Pandemic era, as COVID-19 has shifted residential preferences toward accessing public amenities within walking distance of one's home.
To identify the imbalanced distribution of Living SOC in Dongdaemun-gu, this study examines the current status of public facilities and conducts a survey among residents regarding their usage patterns and perceived needs. Specifically, this research aims to analyze the gap between the actual availability of public facilities and resident perceptions in the areas surrounding Kyung Hee University (Hoegi-dong and Imun-dong).
