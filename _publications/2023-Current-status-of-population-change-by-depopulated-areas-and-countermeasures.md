<b>Abstract</b>: In this study, an open-source Python-based package was developed to enable the measurement of accessibility for various modes of transport, utilizing the National Standard Node-Link data provided as public open data. The primary objective of this research was to reduce the dependency of accessibility evaluations—such as route selection and reaching major Living SOC destinations—on commercial software or online map platform services, ensuring that anyone can use these tools without specific costs or restrictions.
Accordingly, this study constructed a transportation network (graph) consisting of nodes and links using the national standard traffic information network data. An algorithm was developed to calculate service areas based on travel time, taking into account the average speeds of different transportation modes. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the calculated service areas could be effectively utilized for 2SFCA (Two-Step Floating Catchment Area) accessibility assessments.
The future distribution of this package is expected to enhance the convenience of calculating transportation accessibility for researchers. Moreover, continuous algorithm additions and package improvements are anticipated through a feedback loop involving user opinions and suggestions.
