<b> Abstract </b>:  This research investigates visual, structural, and point-of-interest (POI) complexity factors that influence drivers' perception and understanding of traffic conditions at road intersections. It also examines the relationship between intersection complexity and vehicle crashes. Considering that intersection land use varies with urbanization levels, the study categorizes samples into three groups—high-density, medium-density, and low-density—using the Fractional Impervious Surface metric. Fourteen variables were identified to evaluate intersection traffic environment complexity in Atlanta. The findings reveal that in high-density areas, structural factors such as lane count, speed limits, and traffic volume are strongly and positively correlated with traffic accidents. In medium-density areas, structural complexity variables, sky ratio, and the presence of well-known POIs also show positive correlations with crashes. In low- density areas, speed limits are significantly associated with accidents, while a higher vegetation ratio appears to reduce crash occurrences. This study contributes to the field by providing a method to quantify intersection traffic environment complexity and proposing tailored strategies for traffic accident reduction based on urban development levels.
